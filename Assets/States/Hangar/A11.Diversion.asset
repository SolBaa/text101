    running everywhere and mostly yelling at one another. Some men are clambering
    aboard airships, others are attempting to put out fires that have started from
    the explosion.\nWho were those men? Friend or foe? That will have to wait. Time
    to get out of here. \n\nWhat now?\n\n1. Mad sprint to the nearest airship.\n2.
